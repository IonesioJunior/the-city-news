Our city is a collection of islands, and New Yorkers have been using ferries to traverse its waterways for centuries.

The first ferryman in the records, according to an 1853 history of New York, was Cornelius Dircksen, who ran a ferry from Peck Slip in Manhattan to Fulton Ferry in what is now DUMBO in the 1640s. New York City enjoyed a thriving ferry network until the 1960s, when most services were discontinued under Robert Moses.

But in recent years, more city-backed boats have hit the water. In 2013, the city's Economic Development Corporation (EDC), under then-mayor Michael Bloomberg, announced the establishment of a city-run NYC Ferry. The service officially launched in 2017, through a contract with the private, for-profit Hornblower Group.

The service is not without its problems. Even with heavy public investment, the ferry has undergone significant financial troubles, requiring bailouts from city government. Ballooning costs and accusations of mismanagement have plagued the network, as THE CITY has previously reported, with heavily subsidized fares. According to a 2022 report from the city comptroller, those subsidies are almost double their original promised cost.

Weekly ridership has increased steadily since the ferries' launch, from around 110,000 in the summer months of 2017 to around 200,000 in 2024. In winter, numbers drop precipitously, to between 40,000 and 80,000 in 2024. NYC Ferry registered over 7 million boardings during all of 2024. Even so, ridership numbers lag far behind the subway, which in 2024 registered almost 2 billion rides.

NYC Ferry is currently undergoing an "optimization plan" to reduce stops along routes, increase seating capacity on high-traffic routes and times and, it claims, reduce the system's remarkably high subsidies per rider. The release of the updated map -- which includes a route extension connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn -- planned for Fall 2025. New Yorkers can add their input here.

Today, there are six regular routes, plus a seventh weekend route to Governors Island -- spanning over 60 miles -- run by NYC Ferry. A network of private and public operators run many more ferries and routes across the city's waterways. If you're trying to incorporate more sea spray and fewer drips from subway ceilings into your commute, here's your guide.

NYC Ferry

The NYC Ferry operates year-round, from 25 ferry landings across all five boroughs. A one-way ticket costs $4.50, but you'll save money by buying a 10-trip pass for $29.

When NYC Ferry was first introduced, trips cost $2.75 -- the price of a subway ticket. At the time, the low price was criticized for pushing the cost, heavily subsidized by the city, onto taxpayers.

Transfers between ferry lines are free, but transfers to the subways and buses are not. If you want to take the ferry to Wall Street and switch to the subway, for example, you'll have to pay a separate fare.

Seniors, people with disabilities, participants in the Fair Fares program, and high school students (only on weekdays) are eligible for a reduced fare of $1.45.

NYC Ferry operates an additional seasonal summer route to the Rockaways. The Rockaway Rocket connects Long Island City (46th Ave and Center Blvd) and Greenpoint (10 India St.) to Rockaway Beach at 108th Street. One-way tickets on the Rockaway Rocket cost $12. The standard Rockaway route links Wall Street Pier 11 with the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park and the Rockaways.

In summer, when the Rockaway route gets crowded, passengers can reserve a spot on the ferry using the Rockaway Reserve in the NYC Ferry app. Reserve tickets cost $12.

A free shuttle bus operated by NYC ferry makes several stops along the Rockaway peninsula to different beaches, down to Riis Beach.

NYC Ferry's own TikTok account perhaps says it best: "When you realize that NYC Ferry is essentially a public yacht that goes from island to island."

You can buy ferry tickets at ticket machines at the terminals, or from the NYC Ferry App. Find the full list of routes and schedules here.

You may find yourself commuting to work on the Tooth Ferry, Friendship Express or River Sprinter. While the ferries are staffed by adults, many of the boats themselves were named by second graders across the city, from 2017 to 2019.

Staten Island Ferry

The Staten Island Ferry has been in service for more than 200 years -- since 1817, when a steamboat connected New York's least populous borough to Manhattan.

Today, nine bright orange boats serve around 22 million riders annually. They include vessels named for Alice Austen, the pioneering photographer from Staten Island, famed writer and activist Dorothy Day (also a Staten Islander) and Samuel Newhouse, the media businessman whose company still publishes the Staten Island Advance newspaper today.

The Staten Island Ferry, operated by the New York City Department of Transportation, runs 24 hours a day, every day of the year. During rush hour, boats depart St. George Terminal in Staten Island and Whitehall Terminal in Manhattan every 15 or 20 minutes. At night, they leave every 30 minutes. The trip takes around 25 minutes.

The ferry used to charge passengers a small fee - lower than other transit options in the city. In 1990, when the round-trip charge increased to 50 cents, Staten Islanders' indignation helped fuel a vote in favor of secession from New York City. When Rudy Giuliani won the 1993 mayoral election, and made the ferry free to all passengers in 1997, the threat of secession subsided.

The ferry is also ADA accessible, and has free Internet access.

Governors Island

Seasonal ferries connect Governor's Island to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Run by the Trust for Governors Island, these ferries run every 30 minutes between the Battery Maritime Building at 10 South Street in Manhattan and Soissons Landing on Governor's Island. On summer weekends, additional ferries connect Yankee Pier on Governor's Island to Atlantic Basin in Red Hook and Pier 6 in Brooklyn Bridge Park.

Roundtrip tickets cost $5, but trips are free on weekends before 11 a.m. The ferry runs every day year-round.

You can check the schedule and map here. The South Brooklyn route of the NYC Ferry also stops by Governor's Island year-round.

Also, if you've ever wanted to own your own ferry, the Trust for Governor's Island is taking bids for the recently retired M/V Samuel S. Coursen.

Other ferries: New Jersey and beyond

Ferry travel between Manhattan and New Jersey is operated by the private company NY Waterway. Weekday routes connect Edgewater, Hoboken, Jersey City, Weehawken and more to landings at Wall Street, Battery Park and Midtown during commuter hours. One-way tickets cost $12.25, and routes and schedules are listed here.

The Liberty Landing City Ferry, owned by Hornblower, also operates a route between Jersey City and Brookfield Place. One-way tickets cost $10, and ferries leave every hour.

For another island-hopping experience, you can take the free weekend-only Ikea ferry, which departs Manhattan from Pier 79 on West 39th Street, and Pier 11 at South Street, and travels to the Ikea terminal in Red Hook.

The privately run Seastreak Ferries operates several routes running on the more expensive end. The company justifies its hefty price tag by calling itself "the most civilized way to get there."

The daily ferry between Manhattan and Sandy Hook Beach in New Jersey, which requires advance reservation and includes a shuttle service on Sandy Hook, costs $49 round trip.

A commuter ferry connects Belford, Jersey City, and Manhattan for around the same price.

Seastreak also operates a ferry between New York, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. A one-way ticket starts at $185.

Tourist ferries

Yes, they're designed for daytrippers and out-of-towners, but they're open to everyone, including New Yorkers looking for a bit of sea air:

Statue City Cruises run frequent trips between Battery Park, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. $25 roundtrip tickets include access to the Statue of Liberty grounds and Ellis Island museum.

The Circle Line offers several tours of New York's waterways, including a two-and-a-half-hour loop aroundManhattan starting at $49, a 2-hour nighttime tour of the city skyline ($53), and an eight-hour cruise all the way to Bear Mountain State Park ($84).
