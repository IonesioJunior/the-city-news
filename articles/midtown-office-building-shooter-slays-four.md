Four people including a NYPD officer were killed and another person was in critical condition after a shooter stormed a Midtown office building on Monday evening.

The suspected shooter is also dead, city officials said.

One of the victims was Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old off-duty police officer in the 47th Precinct in The Bronx who was working a paid detail, in uniform, providing security in the office tower, which houses financial giants including Blackstone, as well as corporate offices for the National Football League.

Islam was transported to Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he died of his injuries, Mayor Eric Adams said at a press conference at the hospital Monday night.

"He's a true blue New Yorker, not only in a uniform he wore, but in his spirit and energy of loving this city. Earlier tonight, I met with the officer's family," said Adams. "I told them that he was a hero, and we admire him putting his life on the line."

Also among the victims was a security guard and member of 32BJ SEIU's security division, a union spokesperson told THE CITY.

The shooter, identified by police commissioner Jessica Tisch as 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas, killed himself minutes after storming into the building, shooting three people including Islam in the lobby before getting on an elevator, letting a woman exiting it pass him, and going to the 33rd floor where he shot and killed an additional person before apparently taking his own life. That floor houses the offices of real estate giant Rudin Management, which also owns and operates the building.

Tisch said law enforcement believe Tamura acted alone and that the incident is no longer being treated as an active shooter situation. She did not state a motive for the attack, which she said is still under active investigation.

Tamura "has a documented mental health history. His motives are still under investigation, and we are working to understand why he targeted this particular location," said Tisch. The NYPD is working with the FBI and law enforcement in Las Vegas, among others, in its probe.

Islam was an immigrant from Bangladesh and is survived by two children. His wife, Tisch said, is pregnant with their third child.

The NYPD has not publicly named the other victims of the assault, which occurred shortly after 6 p.m. inside the building at 345 Park Avenue. Security camera images showed Tamura walking into the building holding a rifle, which officials later identified as an M4. Four additional people suffered minor injuries while fleeing the building, officials said at the Monday evening briefing.

Law enforcement investigating the crime scene identified a nearby parked car registered in Nevada to Tamura and found "a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver ammunition and magazines, a backpack and medication prescribed" to Tamura, Tisch said.
