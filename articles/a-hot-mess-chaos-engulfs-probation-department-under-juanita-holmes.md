The city Department of Probation is understaffed, overworked and plagued by a revolving door of top officials under Commissioner Juanita Holmes, according to multiple veteran officers and the union leader representing rank-and-file employees.

As of June 1, the department was operating with just 750 staff members, despite having 974 budgeted positions, according to a City Council analysis set to be made public at a hearing Monday. That's a 23% vacancy rate at the public safety agency that supervises thousands of New Yorkers navigating the criminal and family court systems.

Meanwhile, probation violations are on a sharp rise, agency stats show.

"This agency is a hot mess," Councilmember Sandy Nurse (D-Brooklyn), who chairs the Committee on Criminal Justice, told THE CITY. "People are leaving in droves, the programs are being chopped without explanation, technical violations are spiking, and frontline workers -- many of whom are women of color -- are being pushed to the brink."

According to a May 2024 report by the state Comptroller's Office, DOP has the highest employee attrition rate of any city agency, with a turnover spike of 128.6% above pre-pandemic levels -- nearly double the next-highest agency.

Holmes, who previously served as chief of the NYPD's Training Bureau, told the City Council last May that "attrition presents a challenge" but vowed she was "steadfastly prepared to overcome it."

That hasn't happened.

The decrease in officers is largely due to staff fleeing to higher-paying jobs in nearby counties, according to Dalvanie Powell, president of the United Probation Officers Association.

"Probation Officers are proud public servants who play a vital role in keeping our communities safe and helping individuals get back on the right path," she said in a statement to THE CITY. "But ongoing staffing challenges are making that mission harder."

The push for more probation officers also comes at a time when criminal justice experts and advocates are pressing for a greater use of alternatives to jail, including probation and other types of supervised release.

The Department of Probation defended its staffing and hiring and argued it has "addressed shortages" and "streamlined operations."

"Our team is in no way 'rudderless' -- thanks to our Commissioner Juanita N. Holmes, we are secure and equipped to handle any challenge," an unnamed department spokesperson said via email.

The department is working with City Hall to fill "critical positions and ensure that all teams have the resources they need to succeed," the spokesperson added.

Critics contend the numbers alone don't capture the growing disarray.

Nurse said her office has received an "unprecedented flood" of letters, emails, and voicemails from probation officers and staff -- many anonymous, others signed by name -- describing a workplace in crisis.

"There's just this sustained stream of outreach," said Nurse. "They're saying, 'Please help us. We don't know what's going on.'"

Morale has plummeted across the board, critics said, in part due to Holmes' controversial requirement that all probation officers carry firearms, regardless of assignment. Several officers reported feeling undertrained in firearm use and uncomfortable bringing guns into community visits, particularly with youth clients.

The mandate marks a clear shift in philosophy from past department leadership, which emphasized rehabilitation and building community trust over enforcement.

Holmes, who began her career with the NYPD in 1987 and took over the Department of Probation in March 2023, has leaned into what some see as a quasi-law enforcement posture: reinstating blue uniforms that look similar to those worn by police, expanding night field visits, and dramatically increasing home inspections and enforcement sweeps.

"The message now is less caring, more systemic," said Lisa Salvatore, an attorney in charge of the adolescent representation team at Brooklyn Defender Services, which represents low-income clients in criminal cases. "Probation used to be centered on helping people. Now it feels like enforcement."

According to internal data reviewed by City Council staff, the number of "intelligence enforcement events" nearly quadrupled from 1,807 in fiscal year 2022 ending in June to 7,407 in fiscal year 2024.

Losing Leaders

As staffing has dwindled, caseloads ballooned, city records show.

Probation officers who previously juggled 25 high-risk clients now carry upwards of 48 cases across risk levels, Nurse said.

The department has also had major turnover in top key positions, city records show.

In the past 16 months alone, five different people have served as deputy commissioner of Juvenile Operations, the division responsible for overseeing a vulnerable population of young people caught in the criminal justice system.

The current deputy, Patricia Williams, inherited the role after a dizzying carousel of predecessors -- Gineen Gray, Matthew Granoff, Lisa Frost and Joan Gardner -- each served mere months before stepping down or being pushed out, city records show.

Leadership instability isn't confined to juvenile services.

The agency's deputy commissioner for administration, human resources and labor relations has also seen high turnover in the critical post. Albert Culler, the last known holder of the role, left quietly. It's unclear whether anyone currently fills the position.

Multiple deputy and associate commissioners overseeing adult services have resigned or been terminated in recent months, according to department sources who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation.

"There's almost no institutional memory left at the top," Nurse said. "She's brought in a new team, but there's no clarity on vision, and longtime staffers are deeply demoralized."

Holmes has also eliminated the job of court liaison officers, leaving supervising probation officers to appear in family and youth criminal court without staffers who previously served as a crucial bridge during court proceedings.

The court liaison officers helped to guide families, update judges in real time and ensured young people didn't fall through bureaucratic cracks, according to probation department staffers and defense lawyers.

Now, courtroom staff say, families are told to report to the probation office. "We just show up cold," Salvatore said. "The front desk has no idea why you're there and often you wait for hours just to be told they can't do the interview."

The court liaison officers are "the blood that flows between probation and family court and the judges," one probation officer wrote to Nurse's office. The court liaison officers were especially vital in facilitating adjustment services -- a diversion program for low-risk youth that can keep cases out of Family Court entirely. Without the liaison system in place, Salvatore said, fewer cases are being steered out of the court system.

"We're seeing more and more of these low-needs cases pushed into formal proceedings," she added. "This is the opposite of what everyone -- from defense attorneys to judges to prosecutors -- wants."

Internally, Holmes, who declined to comment for this story, has blamed budget cuts for eliminating the court liaison role, according to a department insider involved in the process.

The Council's pre-hearing analysis also found an alarming rise in technical violations -- non-criminal infractions that can result in someone being returned to custody for missing a meeting, breaking curfew or being absent during a surprise home check.

From fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024, the number of technical violations issued by probation officers to youth clients rose by 30%, while violations among adults increased by 50%. Rearrest rates also ticked up during that time: In March 2025, 35% of adults and 30% of juveniles on probation had been re-arrested, both up slightly from the prior year.

Officers say they're being pressured to issue violations at higher rates, even when that undermines trust with clients.

Holmes has also come under fire for abruptly axing several longstanding diversion and support programs, including Next STEPS, AIM (Advocate Intervene Mentor), Works Plus, and IMPACT (Intensive Mentoring/Parents and Children Together) -- often with minimal notice to providers.

In the case of Next STEPS, program partners were given just six days' notice before operations ceased, according to Nurse.

For IMPACT, a highly anticipated high-intensity supervision program, providers had already spent more than $350,000 preparing to launch when Holmes scrapped it entirely.

At the same time, Holmes bought a new $86,590 Ford Expedition Platinum as her new department vehicle in 2024, the Daily News reported.

Holmes has criticized older programs as "ineffective" and lacking metrics, but she's offered little data to support her decisions, according to Nurse.

In Council budget hearings, when pressed about her evaluation criteria, she often cited low participation rates, but refused to provide documentation or analysis showing why engagement was low, or how newer programs would do better.

"She talks about metrics, but we don't get any," Nurse said. "Then she brings in things like virtual-reality training and a program called Girl Talk with no clear way to measure their impact. It's smoke and mirrors."

Holmes also recently tried to bring disciplinary charges against union president Powell, a fierce critic of Holmes, the Daily News reported. The unspecified charges were suddenly withdrawn earlier this month, according to the news outlet.

On Monday, the City Council plans to hold a hearing to grill Holmes about the broader issues facing the department. It was initially planned for last month, but Holmes said she was booked, according to Nurse.

"The workers are crying out," she said. "We're just trying to get them heard."
