A vote on the proposed makeover of a mile-long stretch of industrial Brooklyn coastline has been postponed for the fifth time this year -- once again leaving the future of a $3.5 billion port redevelopment plan up in the air.

The leadership of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal Task Force and the New York City Economic Development Corporation put off a vote that would have required two-thirds approval from the 28-member panel of elected officials and civic leaders.

In a statement, NYCEDC spokesperson Jeff Holmes said several task force members pushed for another delay, citing concerns over the project. The task force leadership -- Rep. Daniel Goldman, state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Councilmember Alexa Aviles -- agreed to the latest postponement.

"In response, and in order to thoughtfully review and work in good faith, Task Force Leadership has decided to postpone today's vote," Holmes said. "This will allow for additional time for meaningful community engagement and conversations to happen with those members and the public who had previously voiced their opposition."

Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso thanked NYCEDC and the task force for delaying a vote on what he called a "once-in-a-generation opportunity" to revitalize the area.

"Our goal from the beginning has been to get to a 'yes' on the BMT vision plan, and Task Force leadership's decision to delay the vote today is the best course of action to enable Task Force members and the community to build a shared vision that maximizes the economic potential for Brooklyn's last working waterfront," Reynoso said in a statement.

The advisory panel was set to weigh in Thursday afternoon on a NYCEDC-led proposal to transform 122 acres of industrial coastline property from south of Brooklyn Bridge Park to Red Hook. Its key components include 6,000 new housing units, green space and transportation upgrades, along with a modernized container port and cruise terminal.

Instead, dozens of local residents who are opposed to the sprawling redevelopment rallied alongside Rep. Jerrold Nadler outside the Columbia Street building where the task force vote would have been held. Some in the crowd held signs that said "Postponed 5 times. EDC doesn't have enough votes. Make better plans."

The task force vote could have cleared the way for the sprawling redevelopment proposal to enter a state-sanctioned review process while bypassing the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) -- with the goal of producing a final plan by early next year.

"The future of Red Hook deserves careful deliberation, not rushed decisions," said Nadler, whose congressional district formerly included a strip of the Brooklyn waterfront. "We can protect our working waterfront while addressing housing needs through proper planning and community engagement."

NYCEDC said in a statement that the decision on a development plan touted by boosters as a "huge opportunity" for the waterfront will now be pushed back to an undetermined date, with sources telling THE CITY that opponents of the plan angled for a multi-month extension.

The latest postponement of the task force vote came even after transportation advocates had warned in a June 11 letter to the panel that "the cost of inaction is too great."

"The Brooklyn Marine Terminal proposal deserves your support," the letter reads. "It doesn't simply react to the past. It anticipates and will build the future -- a city where streets are safe and transit is abundant and reliable."

Aviles, the local representative and vice chair of the task force, told THE CITY that the proposal had been "force fed" on residents and that some task force members were reluctant to back a blueprint that she said has not been "deeply explored."

"We need a plan that is an actual plan, as opposed to, 'Trust me, we're going to be fine in some 20 years,'" Aviles said. "We need an actual plan because residents are deeply concerned."

The proposed redevelopment -- which would extend south from Pier 7 at Atlantic Avenue to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal at Pier 12 -- would significantly outsize Hudson Yards, a development with luxury high-rise housing that was built atop a railyard on Manhattan's West Side.

Of the 122 acres that make up the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, only about half are used for maritime purposes and only one of its six waterfront cranes is in operation at a port that mostly takes in fruits from Latin America and the Caribbean.

Four out-of-service cranes that sit on condemned piers would be demolished and removed, while a $15 million electric crane would be installed as part of the makeover of a port that currently accounts for just 1.4% of all goods coming in and going out of the Port of New York and New Jersey.

In addition, the lightly used Brooklyn Cruise Terminal would be reinvented as open space with a 400-room hotel and publicly accessible piers.

Transportation improvements in an area without subway service would also be a key part of the package, with increased frequency on the B61 bus and ferries, more bus lanes and shuttles to and from subway stations such as the Carroll Street stop along the F and G lines.

But the proposal has faced stubborn opposition from local residents who characterized the process as rushed, even after NYCEDC held several public workshops and information sessions.

Maria Nieto of Voices of the Waterfront, a coalition of Brooklyn locals and organizations formed in response to the planned redevelopment, said the process to build new housing and eventually overhaul one of the city's last working waterfronts had been "deeply, deeply flawed."

"The reason that they have had to postpone it so many times is because, thankfully, we have enough votes for it not to go through," she said.

Critics pushed back on how much housing would be built on the site -- at one point, twice as many units were a possibility -- and also warned against gobbling up some of the city's last remaining industrial waterfront.

Under the plan, the Brooklyn Marine Terminal would be transformed into a 60-acre all-electric port, with 28 acres of public space and one mile of a greenway opening new public access to the shoreline.

The plan took shape following a deal between EDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which last year swapped the Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island for the Brooklyn Marine Terminal.

Gounardes told THE CITY there is no timetable for when another task force vote will be scheduled. He added that some panel members who were previously opposed to the plan have come around in support.

"This cannot be indefinite, obviously," he said. "I think what is in everyone's best interests is for us to let today go by, maybe let a couple days go by and then we start to talk amongst ourselves again about what a path forward looks like in a meaningful way and not just to delay for the sake of delaying."
