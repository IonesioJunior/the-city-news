Thousands of residents in The Bronx and upper Manhattan will soon be able to tap into free Wi-Fi through a new program announced Wednesday, which aims to bridge the digital divide in neighborhoods throughout the city.

A report released earlier this month by think tank Center for an Urban Future found 22% of households in The Bronx don't have any broadband, the highest share in the city, THE CITY reported.

In the neighborhoods of Fordham, Bedford Park and Norwood, more than 30% of households don't have any broadband.

"The internet is no longer just a luxury, it is a necessity," Mayor Eric Adams said at the announcement, held at the Bronx Library Center in Fordham.

"New Yorkers need it but too many people in the 21st century are not having the internet service and the high-speed broadband in their homes," he said.

The initiative, known as "Liberty Link," is a three-year pilot program to connect broadband to 35 buildings in the Bronx and upper Manhattan that are 100% affordable and run through nonprofit organizations. It's being operated through the New York Public Library and the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which is funding it to the tune of $3.25 million.

In the study published earlier this month, affordability was one of the largest issues preventing Bronxites from paying for internet - with barely more than 30% of households making less than $35,000 having broadband internet access.

Elva Laboy, 70, told THE CITY she canceled her Optimum internet at her Hunts Point home four years ago because the $100 monthly fee was too expensive.

The mayor's announcement builds on previous programs to provide internet, including "Big Apple Connect," which provides free internet and cable to 330,000 New Yorkers in 220 public housing facilities. Earlier this year, Adams released a "digital equity roadmap" with lists of ideas to provide more access and better internet service to New Yorkers.

"For the families we serve, the internet isn't a luxury -- it's how you find a job, get your kids through school, stay connected to health care and community," HPD Commissioner Ahmed Tigani said in a statement.

With 'Liberty Link,' we're meeting people where they are and removing a barrier that's held too many New Yorkers back for far too long."
